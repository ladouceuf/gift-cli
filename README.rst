*A gift exchange command line program in Python.*


Purpose

This is an application used to assign a secret santa to every person participating.


Usage

If you've cloned this project, and want to install the library (*and all
development dependencies*), the command you'll want to run is::

    $ pip install -e .[test]

If you'd like to run all tests for this project (*assuming you've written
some*), you would run the following command::
